Image-to-Fiction AI Project                                                                                      
Overview

This project explores the capabilities of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) in generating fiction and educational content from visual inputs. It provides a platform where users can upload images in JPG, PNG, or JPEG formats, and automatically generate captions and narratives based on the uploaded visuals.

The system leverages the Gemini and Claude APIs to tailor narratives according to user preferences. Additionally, users have the option to generate an audio version of the story using the Play.ht API, enhancing the storytelling experience with multimedia elements.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven content creation, offering innovative solutions for storytelling by seamlessly integrating visual and textual inputs.
